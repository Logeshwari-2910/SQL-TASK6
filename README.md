### **Task 6: Subqueries and Nested Queries**

---

### ** Objective**

To apply subqueries within SQL queries to perform advanced data filtering, calculation, and decision-making. This helps in building complex logic using nested queries.

---

### ** Concepts Covered**

####  1. Scalar Subquery

Used when a subquery returns a single value. Often placed inside `SELECT`, `WHERE`, or `HAVING` clauses for comparison or computation.

####  2. Correlated Subquery

This type of subquery refers to columns from the outer query and is evaluated once per row of the outer query.

####  3. Subquery with IN

Filters the main query results using a list of values returned by a subquery.

####  4. Subquery with EXISTS

Checks whether the subquery returns any data. Often used to test the presence of related rows.

####  5. Subquery in FROM

Treats the result of a subquery as a derived table or temporary result set within the main query.

####  6. Comparison Operators in Subqueries

Includes use of operators such as `=`, `> ALL`, and `> ANY` to compare values from the main query with results from a subquery.

###  **Outcome**

By completing this task, you will be able to:

* Understand and distinguish between scalar and correlated subqueries.
* Use subqueries to perform comparisons and conditional logic.
* Embed subqueries inside `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` clauses.
* Apply filters using `IN`, `EXISTS`, `ALL`, `ANY` to fine-tune query results.
* Write efficient nested queries to analyze complex relational data.
